Adaptation of the TRAM Project as a RASA Framework Speech Bot

In 2019 Sara Yoder and Jackie Lasky presented their work on the TRAM-Tool(https://medium.com/mitre-attack/automating-mapping-to-attack-tram-1bb1b44bda76, https://github.com/mitre-attack/tram). It is a NLP tool that can associate Mitre Att&ck Techniques with the text of Threat Intel Reports. The Tram-Bot is an adaptation of this approach using the RASA Framework. The advantage of using RASA are the pre-configured analysis pipelines, multiple input-output abilities and the RASA-X service to retrain models based on analyst feedback.
